# 220 Tutorials - Flashlight Instagram Feed
Get all images from a user's instagram page with a fun flashlight effect

## How it works
Our code uses the Instagram public API to grab all photos from any instagram page (this code uses a profile page, but we can use hashtags too!) It then 
displays them on a webpage, and makes the roor element black and on top of everything so that none are able to be seen. We use a radial-gradient to display a transparent circle,
which looks similar to flashlight. Then we use a mouseover event to update the position of the circle.
